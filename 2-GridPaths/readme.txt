Sure, here's a more concise version of the algorithm:

1. Input: Size `n` of the grid and the grid itself.
2. Check: If the start cell is a trap, output `0` and end.
3. Process: For each non-trap cell, add the number of paths from the cell above it and to its left.
4. Output: Number of paths to the destination cell.

This algorithm calculates the number of paths in a `n x n` grid with traps, 
moving only right or down. The time and space complexity is `O(n^2)`. 
Paths are calculated modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.
