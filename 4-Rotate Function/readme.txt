. Calculate the rotation function F(k) for each rotation k by summing the products 
  of elements with their respective indices after rotation.
. Initialize allsum with the sum of products of elements and their indices in the 
  original array, and sum2 with the sum of elements.
. Iterate through each possible rotation k.
  Update allsum by adjusting for the current rotation.
